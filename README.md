# 🔒 PixelLock

**PixelLock** is a lightweight Java-based encryption and decryption utility that demonstrates core cybersecurity concepts such as data confidentiality and integrity.  
It encrypts and decrypts image files at the pixel level using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), converting images into unreadable ciphertext and back.
